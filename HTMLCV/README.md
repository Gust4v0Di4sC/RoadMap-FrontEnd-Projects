# Single-Page CV Project

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a single-page HTML Curriculum Vitae (CV) to showcase your education, skills, and career history in a clean and semantic manner. The goal is to build a structured webpage using only HTML, preparing it for styling in a future project. By completing this project, you will gain experience in semantic HTML, basic SEO principles, and preparing a webpage for social media sharing.
