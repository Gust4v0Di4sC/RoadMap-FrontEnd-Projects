# Multi-Page HTML Website Project

## Overview
This project aims to teach you how to structure a multi-page website using only HTML, focusing on semantic structure and organization. The website will consist of multiple pages (Homepage, Projects, Articles, and Contact) with a consistent navigation bar across all pages. Styling will be addressed in a separate project. By completing this project, you will learn how to create a well-structured, semantic website ready for future styling and optimization.

## Project Details
- **Objective**: Create a multi-page website using HTML, focusing on semantic structure, navigation, and SEO meta tags.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Create four pages: Homepage, Projects, Articles, and Contact.
  - Include a navigation bar on all pages, linking to each page.
  - Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) to structure the website.
  - Add SEO meta tags in the `<head>` section of each page for better search engine visibility.
  - Include a contact form on the Contact page with fields for name, email, message, etc.
  - Ensure the structure is clean and ready for styling in a future project.
- **Future Scope**: This project serves as a foundation for a subsequent project where CSS will be used to style the website.
